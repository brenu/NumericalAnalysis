[*] Each line of it consists of an expression (it has to follow python syntax):

x**2+2*x+1

[*] The X value you want to look for the derivative of:

e.g.: 1

[*] A value for the function delta (or epsilon):

e.g.: 0.01

[*] And the specification of the derivative order:

e.g.: 1 (first order)
      2 (second order)

[*] ----- INPUT EXAMPLE -----

x**2+2*x+1;0;0.001;2
